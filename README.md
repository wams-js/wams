# WAMS (Workspaces Across Multiple Services) API

The current repository is located at https://github.com/hcilab/wams, which is in active development and is being prepared to move to its permanent home in this repository. 

We are aiming to have a stable release of WAMS in time for the ACM EICS 2023 conference at the end of June 2023.
